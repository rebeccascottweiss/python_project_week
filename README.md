<h1>PAY MY TAB</h1>
I hate waking up in the morning after a night out and realizing that I left my credit card at the bar. The bar probably wasn’t thrilled about it, either. Forgotten credit cards are a liability! The bar risks not getting paid and bartenders can potentially be held liable for fraud!

Pay My Tab gives patrons the ability to open a tab, pay it in one financial transaction, track their total, even leave a tip… all from the bar’s website.

<ul>
  <li>Secure login and registration with validations</li>

  <li>Bar side POS control for bartenders and managers</li>
  <li>Add a tip when paying the tab</li>
  <li>Tab can be closed out by patron or bartender</li>
</ul>
